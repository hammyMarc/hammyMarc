- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @hammyMarc W6MGV
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in RF technology, especially SDR and the hardware that supports it. Also interested in AI applications for RF.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning RF power amplifier theory and practice. My current project involves the contruction of a SDR radio front end based upon the LimeSDR (full sized) and a power amplifier based on the NXP 65V LDMOS silicon. One day, I would like to construct a matching-network-switching arrangement to allow this configuration to cover the ham bands from 160M - 430MHz with a single power transitor.... don't laugh... I think it's possible. We shall see!
